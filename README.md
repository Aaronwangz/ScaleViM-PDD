### 🚀 Getting Started 🚀

We train and test the code on **PyTorch 1.13.0 + CUDA 11.7**. The detailed configuration is mentioned in the paper.

### Create a new conda environment
<pre lang="markdown"> 
conda create -n ScaleViM-PDD python=3.8 
conda activate ScaleViM-PDD  </pre>

###  ⚠️ notice ⚠️
This work is currently under second peer review in the RS journal.
